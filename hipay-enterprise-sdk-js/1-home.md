# HiPay Enterprise JavaScript SDK for tokenization (Direct Post)

The HiPay Enterprise JavaScript SDK for tokenization allows you to tokenize credit or debit cards using the HiPay Enterprise payment platform, directly from the web browser. This method (called Direct Post in the PCI Council terminology) enables you to offer a unified payment workflow to your customers while remaining PCI compliant.

# Security principle

Payment data (card number, card verification code and so on) will never hit your server: they will remain in the browser and will be sent directly to the HiPay Enterprise Secure Vault. This method is called "Direct Post". That way, you can create your own payment form, hosted on your server. Once the user validates the form, payment data are sent to the HiPay Enterprise platform through the HiPay Enterprise JavaScript SDK, which returns a token. Then, you can process payments with the token on the server side.

# Installation

### Using Bower

The easiest way to use the SDK is to install it using [Bower](http://bower.io). To do so, type the following command into a terminal window:

```sh
$ bower install hipay-fullservice-sdk-js#1.*
```

### Cloning the repository

You can clone the repository by typing the following command into a terminal window:

```sh
$ git clone git://github.com/hipay/hipay-fullservice-sdk-js
$ git checkout 1.0.3
```

### Downloading the archive

You can also download the source code in ZIP format.

# Example app

## Scope

You can test our example app which is available in the `example` directory. This app leverages both the HiPay JavaScript SDK and PHP SDK in order to tokenize the card number (in the browser, using the JavaScript SDK) and make a transaction with this token on the server side using the PHP SDK.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

The example app is plug-and-play with Docker. This procedure requires Docker to be installed on your machine.

### Procedure

In order to test the example app, open a terminal and go to the `example` directory. Then, type the following command:

	$ docker-compose up -d

Once the Docker container is up and running, type the following command:

	$ docker-compose run web /bin/bash example/setup.sh

Then, you need to open the following file: `example/credentials.php` to put your own HiPay Enterprise credentials. Follow the instructions inserted in PHP comments.

Finally, open your web browser and go to: http://localhost:8080/example/. 
You should see the form shown in the screenshot above.

# Integration guide

The following integration guide describes step by step how to use the HiPay Enterprise JavaScript SDK for tokenization. The implementation can also be found in the example app (see the previous section).

## Import the JavaScript SDK

To use the SDK, you need to add the following script tag to your HTML pages:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="dist/hipay-fullservice-sdk.js"></script>
```
For better performance, you can use the minified version:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="dist/hipay-fullservice-sdk.min.js"></script>
```

## HTML-side integration
Then, you need to add a payment form to your checkout. Here is a basic HTML example:

```html
<div id="form" class="col-md-5">
  
  <div class="details">Enter your payment details:</div>
  
  <div>
      <div class="input-group" id="card-number">
          <span class="input-group-addon"></span>
          <input id="input-card" type="number" placeholder="Card number" maxlength="16">
      </div>
      <div class="input-group" id="name">
          <span class="input-group-addon"></span>
          <input id="input-name" type="text" placeholder="Cardholder">
      </div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
      <div class="input-group" id="date">
          <span class="input-group-addon"></span>
          <input id="input-month" type="number" placeholder="Month" maxlength="2">
          <input id="input-year" type="number" placeholder="Year" maxlength="4">
      </div>
  <div>
      <div class="input-group col-md-6" id="cvv">
          <span class="input-group-addon"></span>
          <input id="input-cvv" type="number" placeholder="CVV" maxlength="3">
      </div>
      <div id="cvv-button" class="col-md-6">
          <button type="button" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#cvv-modal">?</button>
      </div>
  </div>

  </div>

  <div id="submit-zone">
      <div id="error"></div>
      <button type="button" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#other-method-modal" id="pay-button">Tokenize</button>
  </div>
</div>
```

## JavaScript processing
Once the user validates the form, you must use the JavaScript SDK in order to tokenize the card. Here is an example using *jQuery*:

```js
$("#pay-button").click(function() {

  var params = {
    card_number: $('#input-card')[0].value,
    cvc: $('#input-cvv')[0].value,
    card_expiry_month: $('#input-month')[0].value,
    card_expiry_year: $('#input-year')[0].value,
    card_holder: $('#input-name')[0].value,
    multi_use: '0'
  };


  HiPay.setTarget('stage'); // default is production/live
  
  // These are fake credentials, put your own credentials here (HiPay Enterprise back office > Integration > Security settings and create credentials with public visibility)
  HiPay.setCredentials('11111111.stage-secure-gateway.hipay-tpp.com', 'Test_pMAjfghBqya7TA9jqhYah56');

  HiPay.create(params,
    
    function(result) {
	   
		// The card has been successfully tokenized
			   	
		token = result.token;

    }, 

    function (errors) {
    	
      // An error occurred
      	
      if (typeof errors.message != "undefined") {
        $("#error").text("Error: " + errors.message);
      } else {
        $("#error").text("An error occurred with the request.");
      }
    }
  );

  return false;
});
```

Once the token is retrieved, you can process a payment on the server side. Check out the example app's source code for more information.
